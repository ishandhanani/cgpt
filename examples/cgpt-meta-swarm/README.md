# Meta-Swarm Framework

A framework for coordinated multi-agent analysis through cgpt.

## Components

    agent-analysis.sh        Multi-agent coordination system
    perspective-coordinator.sh   Perspective analysis system
    cgpt-meta-swarm.sh         Core swarm framework

## Analysis Patterns

1. Agent-based Analysis
   - Multiple specialized agents
   - Focused expertise domains
   - Coordinated insights
   - Synthesized recommendations

2. Perspective Coordination
   - Task requirement analysis
   - Domain identification
   - Multi-viewpoint evaluation
   - Conflict resolution

3. Meta-swarm Operations
   - Dynamic agent assembly
   - Recursive analysis
   - Self-improvement loops
   - Pattern recognition

## Usage

Basic Analysis:
    ./agent-analysis.sh "analyze this system"
    ./perspective-coordinator.sh "evaluate this design"
    ./cgpt-meta-swarm.sh "improve these patterns"

Advanced Operations:
    # Continue analysis
    cgpt -I $HIST -O $HIST

    # Add perspective
    cgpt -I $HIST -O $HIST -p '<agent role="security">'

    # Fork analysis
    cgpt -I $HIST -O new-direction.cgpt
